# Aircraft Risk Assessment Project

## Project Overview
This project identifies the lowest-risk aircraft for the company’s new aviation division by analyzing historical flight safety data.The aviation accident historical data is from the National Transportation Safety Board from 1962 to 2023 and its about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.Through thorough data cleaning, imputation, and risk assessment, I transformed raw accident records into actionable insights to guide strategic purchasing decisions and minimize operational liability.

## Business Problem
Our organization is entering the aviation sector with no prior operational history, creating significant exposure to safety and financial liabilities. Without a data-driven understanding of aircraft reliability, the company risks investing in high-maintenance or accident-prone models. This project identifies aircrafts with the highest safety ratings and lowest historical risk profiles to ensure a secure market entry.

## Objectives
1. To develop a list of aircraft makes, models and categories categorized by their safety performance.
2. To identify the aircrafts that demonstrate the highest-operational resilience-those that remain safe even in challenging environments or critical flight phases.

## Data Understanding and Analysis
The data used in this project is a csv file named `Aviation_Data`from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.

It contains 31 columns and 90348 rows before data cleaning and analysis.
